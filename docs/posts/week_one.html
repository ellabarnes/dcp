          Parks, parks, lectures, and some more parks. My dad and I started our
          travels on the 6th, and spent the night in Tallahassee where we had
          our obligatory first night in Florida Cracker Barrel dinner. The next
          day we got up before the sun, and high tailed it to Hollywood Studios.
          We were able to get on every single ride at the park. We even rode
          Smuggler’s Run and Tower of Terror three times each! I was incredibly
          brave and rode Rockin’ Rollercoaster for the first time ever, and
          despite how I looked on the ride photo, I really liked it. I moved
          into my new apartment on the 8th, and got to meet all my lovely
          roommates. My dad and I got to experience EPCOT’s Food and Wine
          Festival for the first time on the 9th. Sadly none of the food that we
          tried was that outstanding, but getting to ride Cosmic Rewind made up
          for it. That ride is absolutely incredible, and literally had me in
          awe! Remy’s Ratatoullie Adventure was also great, and smelled
          fantastic. We hit Magic Kingdom, my new workplace, on the 10th and
          were a little disappointed with Tron, but mostly just because of the
          length of the ride. The star of Magic Kingdom was 100 percent the
          hazelnut spread waffle; absolutely delicious. 10 out of 10 in my book.
          My dad’s last day in Florida was the 11th, so we took a quick trip to
          Animal Kingdom. Get this, we rode Flight of Passage with a 20 minute
          wait! Unheard of for us summertime guests. Obviously we had to get
          multiple rides on Dinosaur in, and we did. I dropped my dad off at the
          airport, and headed to Magic Kingdom with two of my roommates and
          another friend later that day. The 12th through the 14th were much
          less eventful compared to the rest of the week as I was mostly doing
          training. That’s all for now, and I’ll check back in next week!

          I tried a lot of food this week, so don’t expect to see this much ever
          again as I will no longer have access to my dad’s credit card. The
          worst thing I ate this week was a Mickey Pretzel in EPCOT. Now I love
          pretzels but this particular pretzel was lowkey undercooked, and the
          cheese sauce probably had zero dairy in it. I can get down with some
          fake cheese, but not this one. By far the best thing I ate this week
          was the meatloaf at 50s Prime Time Cafe in Hollywood Studios. I know
          that sounds insane, but that meatloaf was insanely good. I thought I
          hated meatloaf, but I am now a changed woman. I will be eating
          meatloaf at “mom’s house” again. No, I did not take any pictures of my
          food, because I was too busy living in the moment. Honorable mention
          to the Beignets in Magic Kingdom, they were also pretty good.
